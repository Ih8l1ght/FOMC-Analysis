 Balance Sheet Normalization  
Committee participants resu med their discussion from 
the January 2019 meeting on options for transitioning to the longer-run size of the balance sheet.  The staff de-
scribed options for ending th e reduction in the Federal 
Reserve’s securities holdings at the end of September 2019 and for potentially reducing the pace of redemp-tions of Treasury securities before that date.  Reducing the pace of redemptions befo re ending them would be 
consistent with most previous changes in the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet policy and would support a grad-ual transition to the long-run level of reserves.  It could 
also reinforce the Committee’s communications indicat-
ing that the FOMC was flexible in its plans for balance 
sheet normalization and that  the process of balance 
sheet normalization would remain consistent with the at-
tainment of the Federal Re serve’s monetary policy ob-
jectives.  However, continuing redemptions at the cur-rent pace through Septembe r might be simpler to com-
municate and would somewhat shorten the transition to 
the long-run level of reserves.  The staff noted that re-
ducing the pace of redemp tions before September 
would leave reserves and the balance sheet slightly larger than continuing redemptions at the current pace through September.  However, the longer-run level of reserves 
and size of the balance sheet would ultimately be deter-mined by long-term demand for Federal Reserve liabili-
ties.  Staff projections of term premiums and macroeco-
nomic outcomes did not differ  substantially across the 
two options. 
The staff also described a possible interim plan for rein-
vesting principal payments received from agency debt Page 2 Federal Open Market Committee____________________________________________________________________________________________ _and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) after bal-
ance sheet runoff ends and until the Committee decides on the longer-run composition of the System Open Mar-
ket Account (SOMA) portfolio.  Consistent with the 
Committee’s long-standing aim to hold primarily Treas-
ury securities in the longer run, any principal payments on agency debt and agency MBS would generally be re-invested in Treasury securities in the secondary market.  These reinvestments would be allocated across sectors of the Treasury market roughly in proportion to the ma-turity composition of Treasury securities outstanding.  However, the plan would maintain the existing $20 bil-
lion per month cap on MBS re demptions; principal pay-
ments on agency debt and agency MBS above $20 billion per month would continue to be reinvested in agency 
MBS.  This cap would limit th e pace at which the Federal 
Reserve’s agency MBS holdings could decline if prepay-ments accelerated; the staff projected that the redemp-
tion cap on agency debt and agency MBS was unlikely to be reached after 2019. 
The staff noted that, once balance sheet runoff ended, 
the average level of reserves would tend to decline grad-ually, in line with trend growth in the Federal Reserve’s nonreserve liabilities, until the Committee chose to re-sume growth of the balance sheet in order to maintain a 
level of reserves consistent with efficient and effective policy implementation. 
Participants judged that ending the runoff of securities 
holdings at the end of September would reduce uncer-
tainty about the Federal Reserve’s plans for its securities holdings and would be consistent with the Committee’s decision at its January 2019 meeting to continue imple-menting monetary policy in a regime of ample reserves.  
Participants discussed advant ages and disadvantages of 
slowing balance sheet runoff before the September stop-
ping date.  A slowing in th e pace of redemptions would 
accord with the Committee’s general practice of adjust-
ing its holdings of securities smoothly and predictably, 
which might reduce the risk that market volatility would arise in connection with the conclusion of the runoff of 
securities holdings.  However, these advantages needed 
to be weighed against the additional complexity of a plan that would end balance sheet runoff in steps rather than all at once.  
Participants reiterated their support for the FOMC’s in-
tention to return to holding primarily Treasury securities 
in the long run.  Participants judged that adopting an in-terim approach for reinvesting agency debt and agency MBS principal payments into Treasury securities across a range of maturities was appropriate while the Commit-
tee continued to evaluate potential long-run maturity structures for the Federal Reserve’s portfolio of Treas-
ury securities.  Many participants offered preliminary 
views on advantages and disadvantages of alternative 
compositions for the SOMA portfolio.  Participants ex-pected to further discuss the longer-run composition of 
the portfolio at upcoming meetings. 
Participants commented on c onsiderations related to al-
lowing the average level of reserves to decline in line with trend growth in nonreser ve liabilities for a time af-
ter the end of balance sheet runoff.  Several participants 
preferred to stabilize the average level of reserves by re-
suming purchases of Treasury securities relatively soon after the end of runoff, because they saw little benefit to 
further declines in reserve balances or because they 
thought the Committee should minimize the risk of in-terest rate volatility that co uld occur if the supply of re-
serves dropped below a point consistent with efficient and effective implementation of policy.  Some others 
preferred to allow the average level of reserves to con-
tinue to decline for a longer time after balance sheet run-off ends because such declines could allow the Commit-tee to learn more about underlying reserve demand, be-
cause they judged that such a process was not likely to result in excessive volatility  in money market rates, or 
because they judged that moving to lower levels of re-serves was more consistent with the Committee’s previ-
ous communications indicating that it would hold no 
more securities than necess ary for implementing mone-
tary policy efficiently and effectively.  Participants noted that the eventual resumption of purchases of securities to keep pace with growth in demand for the Federal Re-serve’s liabilities, whenever it occurred, would be a nor-
mal part of operations to maintain the ample-reserves 
monetary policy implementation regime and would not 
represent a change in the stance of monetary policy.  
Some participants suggested that, at future meetings, the Committee should discuss the potential benefits and costs of tools that might re duce reserve demand or sup-
port interest rate control.  
Following the discussion, the Chair proposed that the 
Committee communicate its intentions regarding bal-ance sheet normalization by publishing a statement at 
the conclusion of the meeting.  All participants agreed 
that it was appropriate to issue the proposed statement. Minutes of the Meeting of March 19–20, 2019 Page 3 ____________________________________________________________________________________________ _BALANCE SHEET NORMALIZATION 
PRINCIPLES AND PLANS 
(Adopted March 20, 2019) In light of its discussions at previous meetings and the 
progress in normalizing the si ze of the Federal Reserve’s 
securities holdings and the level of reserves in the bank-ing system, all participants agreed that it is appropriate at this time for the Committee to provide additional infor-mation regarding its plans for the size of its securities holdings and the transition to the longer-run operating regime.  At its January meeting, the Committee stated 
that it intends to continue to implement monetary policy 
in a regime in which an ample supply of reserves ensures 
that control over the level of  the federal funds rate and 
other short-term interest rates is exercised primarily through the setting of the Federal Reserve’s adminis-
tered rates and in which acti ve management of the sup-
ply of reserves is not required.  The Statement Regarding 
Monetary Policy Implemen tation and Balance Sheet 
Normalization released in January as well as the princi-
ples and plans listed below together revise and replace 
the Committee’s earlier Policy Normalization Principles and Plans. 
xTo ensure a smooth transition to the longer-run 
level of reserves consistent with efficient and effec-tive policy implementation, the Committee intends to slow the pace of the decline in reserves over com-
ing quarters provided that the economy and money 
market conditions evolve about as expected. 
oThe Committee intends to slow the reduction 
of its holdings of Treasury securities by reduc-ing the cap on monthly redemptions from the current level of $30 billion to $15 billion begin-ning in May 2019. 
oThe Committee intends to conclude the reduc-
tion of its aggregate securities holdings in the 
System Open Market Account (SOMA) at the end of September 2019. 
oThe Committee intends to continue to allow its 
holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) to decline, consistent with the aim of holding primarily Treasury se-curities in the longer run. 
Beginning in October 2019, principal pay-
ments received from agency debt and agency MBS will be reinvested in Treasury securities subject to a maximum amount of $20 billion per month; any principal pay-
ments in excess of that maximum will con-tinue to be reinvested in agency MBS. 
Principal payments from agency debt and 
agency MBS below the $20 billion maxi-mum will initially be invested in Treasury securities across a range of maturities to roughly match the maturity composition of Treasury securities outstanding; the Com-
mittee will revisit this reinvestment plan in 
connection with its de liberations regarding 
the longer-run composition of the SOMA portfolio. 
It continues to be the Committee’s view 
that limited sales of agency MBS might be warranted in the longer run to reduce or eliminate residual holdings.  The timing and pace of any sales would be communicated to the public well in advance. 
oThe average level of reserves after the FOMC 
has concluded the reduction of its aggregate se-curities holdings at the end of September will 
likely still be somewhat above the level of re-
serves necessary to efficiently and effectively implement monetary policy. 
In that case, the Committee currently antic-
ipates that it will likel y hold the size of the 
SOMA portfolio roughly constant for a 
time.  During such a pe riod, persistent grad-
ual increases in currency and other non- reserve liabilities would be accompanied by corresponding gradual declines in reserve balances to a level consistent with efficient and effective implementation of monetary policy. 
oWhen the Committee judges that reserve bal-
a n c e s  h a v e  d e c l i n e d  t o  t h i s  l e v e l ,  t h e  S O M A  portfolio will hold no more securities than nec-essary for efficient and effective policy imple-mentation.  Once that point is reached, the Committee will begin increasing its securities holdings to keep pace with trend growth of the Federal Reserve’s non-reserve liabilities and 
maintain an appropriate le vel of reserves in the 
system. 
Developments in Financial Markets and Open 
Market Operations The manager of the SOMA di scussed developments in 
global financial market s over the intermeeting period.  In Page 4 Federal Open Market Committee____________________________________________________________________________________________ _the United States, equity indexes moved higher and 
credit spreads tightened.  Market participants attributed these moves largely to a perceived shift in the FOMC’s approach to policy followin g communications stressing 
that the Committee would be patient in assessing the 
need for future adjustments in the target range for the federal funds rate an d would be flexible on balance sheet 
policy.  
In Europe, measures announced by the European Cen-
tral Bank (ECB) in March, in cluding an extension of for-
ward guidance on interest rates and the announcement of another round of targeted  long-term refinancing op-
erations, were followed by a decline in euro-area equity 
markets, particularly  bank stocks, as well as declines in 
euro-area rates.  Market contacts attributed the price re-action to a perception that the measures were not as stimulative as might have been expected, given down-ward revisions in the ECB’s growth and inflation fore-casts.  In China, authorities moved toward an easier fis-cal and monetary stance; China’s aggregate credit growth 
had rebounded slightly in rece nt months relative to the 
declining trend observed last year.  The Shanghai Com-posite index had risen notably since the turn of the year, 
driven in part by fiscal an d monetary stimulus measures 
as well as perceived progress  on trade negotiations. De-
velopments around Brexit remained a source of market uncertainty.  Consistent with ongoing investor uncer-tainty over the outcome, risk reversals on the pound–
dollar currency pair continued to point to higher de-
mand for protection against pound depreciation relative to the dollar. 
The deputy manager provided an overview of money 
market developments and policy implementation over the intermeeting period.  The effective federal funds rate (EFFR) continued to be very st able at a level equal to the 
interest rate on excess reserves.  Rates in overnight se-
cured markets continued to ex hibit some volatility, par-
ticularly on month-end dates.  Market participants at-tributed some of the volatilit y in overnight secured rates 
to persistently high net dealer  inventories of Treasury se-
curities and to Treasury issuance coinciding with the month-end statement dates.  Over the upcoming inter-meeting period, with the comb ination of changes in the 
Treasury’s balances at the Federal Reserve and additional 
asset redemptions, reserves were expected to decline to 
a new low of around $1.4 trillio n by early May, with some 
notable fluctuations in reserves on days associated with tax flows.   The deputy manager also discussed the transition to a 
long-run regime of ample reserves, following the Com-mittee’s January announcement that it intends to con-
tinue to implement monetary policy in such a regime.  
Once the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet has 
normalized, the Open Market Desk will at some point 
need to conduct open market  operations to maintain a 
level of reserves in the ba nking system that the Commit-
tee deems appropriate.  In doing so, the Desk will need 
to assess banks’ demand for re serves as well as forecast 
other Federal Reserve liabiliti es and plan operations to 
maintain a supply of reserves sufficient to ensure that 
control over short-term inte rest rates is exercised pri-
marily through the setting of administered rates.  
The deputy manager describe d a possible operational ap-
proach in an ample-reserves  regime based on establish-
ing a minimum operating level that would be a lower bound on the daily level of reserves.  The assessment of the minimum operating level of  reserves would be based 
on a range of information, including surveys of banks 
and market participants, data  on banks’ reserve holdings, 
and market monitoring.  Under the proposed approach, the Desk would plan open ma rket operations to main-
tain the daily level of rese rves above the minimum oper-
ating level.  Consistent wi th the Committee’s intention 
to maintain a regime that does not require active man-agement of the supply of reserves, the Desk could plan these open market operation s over a medium-term hori-
zon.  The average level of reserves over the medium 
term would then be above th e minimum operating level, 
providing a buffer of reserves to absorb daily changes in nonreserve liabilities.  
Following the manager and deputy manage r’s report, 
some participants commented on various aspects of the 
minimum operating level appr oach.  Decisions regarding 
how far to allow reserves to decline would need to bal-
ance important tradeoffs.  On the one hand, a lower 
minimum operating level might increase the risk of ex-
cessive interest rate volat ility.  On the other hand, a 
lower minimum operating le vel could provide more op-
portunities to learn about un derlying reserve demand or 
could be viewed as more consistent with moving to the 
smallest securities holdings necessary for efficient and effective monetary policy implementation.  However, 
the scope for reducing the leve l of reserves much further 
after the end of balance shee t runoff might be fairly lim-
ited.   
By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s 
domestic transactions over the intermeeting period.  Minutes of the Meeting of March 19–20, 2019 Page 5 ____________________________________________________________________________________________ _There were no intervention operations in foreign curren-
cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe-riod. 
Staff Review of the Economic Situation 
The information available for the March 19–20 meeting 
indicated that labor market conditions remained strong, 
although growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) 
appeared to have slowed markedly in the first quarter of this year from its solid four th-quarter pace.  Consumer 
price inflation, as measured by the 12-month percentage 
change in the price index for personal consumption ex-penditures (PCE), was somewh at below 2 percent in De-
cember, held down in part by recent declines in con-
sumer energy prices, while PC E price inflation for items 
other than food and energy wa s close to 2 percent; more 
recent readings on PCE price inflation were delayed by the earlier federal government shutdown.  Survey-based measures of longer-run inflat ion expectations were little 
changed on balance. 
Increases in total nonfar m payroll employment re-
mained solid, on average, in recent months; employment 
rose only a little in February  but had expanded strongly 
in January.  The national unemployment rate edged 
down, on net, over the past two months to 3.8 percent 
in February, and both the labor  force participation rate 
and the employment-to-population ratio rose slightly on 
balance.  The unemployment rates for African Ameri-cans, Asians, and Hispanics in  February were at or below 
their levels at the end of the previous economic expan-
sion, though persistent differentials in unemployment rates across groups remained.  The share of workers em-ployed part time for economic reasons moved down in February and was below the lo ws reached in late 2007.  
The rate of private-sector job openings in January was 
the same as its fourth-quarter average and remained ele-vated, while the rate of quits edged up in January; the 
four-week moving average of initial claims for unem-
ployment insurance benefits  through early March was 
still near historically low levels.  Average hourly earnings for all employees rose 3.4 pe rcent over the 12 months 
ending in February, a significantly faster pace than a year earlier.  The employment co st index for private-sector 
workers increased 3 percent over the 12 months ending in December, somewhat faster than a year earlier.  Total 
labor compensation per hour in the business sector in-
creased 2.9 percent over the four quarters of 2018, about the same rate as a year earlier. 
Industrial production declined in January and rebounded 
only somewhat in February.  Moreover, manufacturing 
output decreased over both months, as production in the motor vehicle and parts sector contracted notably in 
January and declines were more broad based in Febru-
ary.  Production in the mining and utilities sectors ex-panded, on net, over the past  two months.  Automakers’ 
assembly schedules suggested that the production of 
light motor vehicles would be roughly flat in the near term, and new orders indexe s from national and regional 
manufacturing surveys pointed  to only modest gains in 
overall factory output in the coming months. 
Household spending looked to be slowing around the 
turn of the year.  Real PCE decreased markedly in De-cember after a solid increase in the previous month, and 
the components of the nominal retail sales da ta used by 
the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) to estimate PCE rebounded only partially in January.  Key factors 
that influence consumer spending—including a low un-employment rate, ongoing gain s in real labor compensa-
tion, and still elevated measures of households’ net worth—were supportive of a pickup in consumer spending to a solid pace in the near term.  In addition, 
consumer sentiment, as measured by the University of 
Michigan Surveys of Consumer s, stepped up in February 
and early March to an upbeat level. 
Real residential investment ap peared to be softening fur-
ther in the first quarter, like ly reflecting, in part, de-
creases in the affordability of housing arising from both the net increase in mortgage interest rates over the past year and ongoing house price appreciation.  Starts of 
new single-family homes increa sed slightly, on net, over 
December and January, while starts of multifamily units 
declined.  Building permit issuance for new single-family homes—which tends to be a good indicator of the un-derlying trend in construction of such homes—moved down over those two months.  In addition, sales of both new and existing homes de creased in January.  
Growth in real private expenditures for business equip-
ment and intellectual property looked to be slowing in 
the first quarter.  Nominal shipments of nondefense cap-
ital goods excluding aircraft rose in December and Jan-uary, while available indicators  pointed to a decrease in 
transportation equipment spending in the first quarter after a strong fourth-quarter  gain.  Forward-looking in-
dicators of business equipment spending—such as or-
ders for nondefense capital g oods excluding aircraft and 
readings on business sentiment—pointed to sluggish in-
creases in the near term.  No minal business expenditures 
for nonresidential structures outside of the drilling and mining sector increased in December and January.  In addition, the number of crude oil and natural gas rigs in Page 6 Federal Open Market Committee____________________________________________________________________________________________ _operation—an indicator of bu siness spending for struc-
tures in the drilling and mining sector—expanded, on balance, in February and th rough the middle of March. 
Total real government purcha ses appeared to be moving 
sideways in the first quarter.  Relatively strong increases 
in real federal defense purchases were likely to be roughly offset by an expected decline in real nondefense purchases stemming from the effects of the partial fed-
eral government shutdown.  Real purchases by state and local governments looked to be rising modestly in the first quarter, as the payrolls  of those governments ex-
panded a bit in January and February, and nominal state 
and local construction spending  rose, on net, in Decem-
ber and January. 
The nominal U.S. international trade deficit narrowed in 
November before widening in December to the largest deficit since 2008.  Exports declined in November and December, as exports of industrial supplies and automo-tive products fell in both mo nths.  Imports decreased in 
November before partially recovering in December, 
with imports of consumer goods and industrial supplies 
driving this swing.  The BE A estimated that the change 
in net exports was a drag of  about ¼ percentage point 
on the rate of real GDP growth in the fourth quarter.  
Total U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the PCE 
price index, increased 1.7 percent over the 12 months ending in December, slightly slower than a year earlier, 
as consumer energy prices declined a little and consumer 
food prices rose only modestly.  Core PCE price infla-
tion, which excludes changes in consumer food and en-ergy prices, was 1.9 percent over that same period, some-what higher than a year earl ier.  The consumer price in-
dex (CPI) rose 1.5 percent ov er the 12 months ending in 
February, while core CPI inflation was 2.1 percent.  Re-cent readings on survey-based measures of longer-run 
inflation expectations—including those from the Michi-
gan survey, the Blue Chip Economic Indicators, and the 
Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants—were little  changed on balance. 
Economic growth in foreig n economies slowed further 
in the fourth quarter.  This development reflected slow-ing in the Canadian economy and some emerging market economies (EMEs), including Brazil and Mexico, along with continued economic weakne ss in the euro area and 
China.  In the advanced foreign economie s (AFEs), re-
cent data suggested that economic activity, especially in the manufacturing sector, remained subdued in the first 
quarter of this year.  Economic activity also remained 
weak in many EMEs, particul arly in Mexico and emerg-
ing Asia excluding China, although some data pointed to a modest pickup in China.  Inflation in foreign econo-
mies slowed further early this year, partly reflecting 
lower retail energy prices across both AFEs and EMEs.  
Staff Review of the Financial Situation 
Investor sentiment toward risky assets continued to im-
prove over the intermeeting pe riod.  Market participants 
cited accommodative monetary policy communications and optimism for a trade deal between the United States and China as factors that contributed to the improve-ment.  Broad equity price indexes increased notably, cor-porate bond spreads narrowed, and measures of equity 
market volatility declined.  Meanwhile, financing condi-
tions for businesses and hous eholds improved slightly 
and generally remained supporti ve of economic activity.   
FOMC communications issued following the January 
meeting were generally viewed by market participants as more accommodative than expected.  Subsequent com-munications—including the minutes of the January FOMC meeting, the Chair’s se miannual testimony to the 
Congress, and speeches by FOMC participants—were 
interpreted as reflecting a pa tient approach to monetary 
policy in the near term and a likely conclusion to the Federal Reserve’s balance shee t reduction by the end of 
this year.  The market-implied path for the federal funds 
rate in 2019 declined slightly over the period, while in-vestors continued to expect  no change to the target 
range for the federal funds rate at the March FOMC meeting.  The market-implied path of the federal funds 
rate for 2020 and 2021 shifted down a little. 
Yields on nominal Treasury securities declined a bit 
across the Treasury yield curve over the intermeeting pe-riod.  Communications from FOMC participants that were more accommodative than expected amid muted readings on inflation, communications from other major 
central banks that, on balanc e, were also regarded as 
more accommodative than expected, and generally 
mixed economic data releases reportedly contributed to 
the decrease in yields and outweighed improved risk sen-timent.  The spread between the yields on nominal  10- and 2-year Treasury securities was little changed over the period and remained in the lower end of its historical range of recent deca des.  Measures of inflation compen-
sation derived from Treasury  Inflation-Protected Secu-
rities increased modestly, on net, although they remained 
below levels seen last fall. 
Major U.S. equity price inde xes increased over the inter-
meeting period, with broad-based gains across sectors.  Improved prospects for a trade deal between the United States and China and accommodative monetary policy were cited as driving factors that outweighed weaker-Minutes of the Meeting of March 19–20, 2019 Page 7 ____________________________________________________________________________________________ _than-expected announcements of corporate earnings for 
the fourth quarter of 2018 and earnings projections for 2019.  Consistent with repo rts about a potential trade 
deal, stock prices of firms with greater exposure to China 
generally outperformed the S&P 500 index.  Option- 
implied volatility on the S&P 500 index at the one-month horizon—the VIX—declined and reached its lowest point this year.  Spreads on investment- and spec-
ulative-grade corporate bonds narrowed, consistent with 
the gains in equity prices, bu t were still wider than levels 
observed last fall.   
Conditions in short-term fu nding markets generally re-
mained stable over the intermeeting period.  The EFFR 
was consistently equal to the rate of interest on excess reserves, while take-up in the overnight reverse repur-chase agreement facility remained low.  Yield spreads on commercial paper and negotiable certificates of deposit generally narrowed further fr om their elevated year-end 
levels, likely reflecting an incr ease in investor demand for 
short-term financial assets.  Meanwhile, the statutory 
federal government debt ce iling was reestablished at 
$22 trillion on March 1. 
The prices of foreign risky assets broadly tracked the 
positive moves in similar U.S. assets over the intermeet-ing period.  Communications by major central banks, 
which were, on net, more accommodative than ex-pected, along with optimism regarding trade negotia-tions between the United Stat es and China, contributed 
to the upward price moves and more than offset the ef-
fects of continued concer ns about foreign economic 
growth.  In particular, global equity prices generally ended the period higher, and dedicated emerging market 
funds continued to see inflows.   At the same time, long-
term AFE yields declined somewhat, on net, on commu-nications from major foreig n central banks and inves-
tors’ concerns about fore ign economic growth.   
The broad dollar index apprec iated slightly as the exten-
sion of accommodative policie s and revised guidance by 
major foreign centra l banks weighed on AFE currencies.  
An exception was the British pound, which strengthened a bit against the dollar, as market participants viewed re-cent Parliamentary votes as reducing the likelihood of a 
no-deal Brexit.  
Financing conditions for nonfi nancial businesses contin-
ued to be accommodative over all.  Gross issuance of 
both investment-grade and high-yield corporate bonds 
was strong in January and February, recovering from the low levels observed late last year.  Issuance in the insti-
tutional syndicated leveraged loan market also recovered in the first two months of the year, as new issuance in February was in line with average monthly new issuance 
in 2018, and spreads narrowed somewhat from their De-cember levels.  The credit qu ality of nonfinancial corpo-
rations continued to show si gns of deterioration, al-
though actual defaults remained low overall.  Commer-
cial and industrial lending showed continued strength in January and February.  Small business credit market con-ditions were little changed, an d credit conditions in mu-
nicipal bond markets stayed accommodative on net.   
Private-sector analysts revised down their projections 
for 2019 and year-ahead corporate earnings a bit.  The 
pace of gross equity issuance was sluggish in January but 
ticked up in February, consistent with the uptick in the 
stock market.      
In the commercial real estate (CRE) sector, financing 
conditions continued to be  generally accommodative.  
Commercial mortgage-backe d securities (CMBS) 
spreads declined over the intermeeting period, with  triple-B spreads moving down to near their late- 
November levels.  Issuance of non-agency CMBS re-
mained strong through February, and CRE lending by 
banks grew at a strong pace in February following rela-
tively sluggish growth in January.  
Residential mortgage financin g conditions remained ac-
commodative on balance.  Pu rchase mortgage origina-
tion activity was flat in Dece mber but edged up in Janu-
ary, as mortgage rates remained lower than the peak 
reached last November.   
Financing conditions in consumer credit markets were 
little changed in recent months and remained generally supportive of household spending.  Credit card loan growth remained strong through December, though the pace slowed during 2018 amid tighter lending standards by commercial banks.  Auto  loan growth remained 
steady through the end of 2018. 
Staff Economic Outlook 
The U.S. economic projection prepared by the staff for 
the March FOMC meeting was revised down a little on balance.  This revision reflected the effects of weaker-than-expected incoming da ta on both aggregate domes-
tic spending and foreign economic growth that were 
only partially offset by a some what higher projected path 
for domestic equity prices and a lower projected trajec-tory for interest rates.  The staff forecast that U.S. real 
GDP growth would slow markedly in the first quarter, 
reflecting a softening in growth of both consumer 
spending and business investment.  But the staff judged that the first-quarter slowdown would be transitory and that real GDP growth would bounce back solidly in the Page 8 Federal Open Market Committee____________________________________________________________________________________________ _second quarter.  In the medium-term projection, real 
GDP growth was forecast to run at a rate similar to the staff’s estimate of potential output growth in 2019 and 2020—a somewhat lower trajec tory, on net, for real 
GDP than in the previous projection—and then slow to 
a pace below potential output growth in 2021.  The staff revised up slightly its assumed underlying trend in the labor force participation rate , raising the level of poten-
tial output a bit, which contributed—along with the lower projected path for re al GDP—to an assessment 
that resource utilization was a little less tight than in the previous forecast.  The un employment rate was pro-
jected to decline a little further below the staff’s estimate 
of its longer-run natural ra te but to bottom out by the 
end of this year and begin to  edge up in 2021.  With labor 
market conditions judged to still be tight, the staff con-tinued to assume that pr ojected employment gains 
would manifest in smaller-than-usual downward pres-sure on the unemployment ra te and in larger-than-usual 
upward pressure on the labor force participation rate.   
The staff’s forecast for inflation was revised down 
slightly for the March FOMC meeting, reflecting some recent softer-than-expected readings on consumer prices.  Core PCE price inflat ion was expected to remain 
at 1.9 percent over this year as a whole and then to edge up to 2 percent for the remainder of the medium term.  Total PCE price inflation was forecast to run a bit below 
core inflation over the next three years, reflecting pro-
jected declines in energy prices.   
The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections 
for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla-tion as generally similar to the average of the past 20 years.  The staff also saw the risks to the forecasts for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate as roughly balanced.  On the upside, household spending and busi-ness investment could expand  faster than the staff pro-
jected, supported by the tax cuts enacted at the end of 
2017, still strong overall labor market conditions, and upbeat consumer sentiment.  In addition, financial con-ditions might not tighten as much as assumed in the staff forecast.  On the downside, the recent softening in a number of economic indicators could be the harbinger of a substantial deteriorat ion in economic activity.  
Moreover, trade policies an d foreign economic develop-
ments could move in directi ons that have significant 
negative effects on U.S. econom ic growth.  Risks to the 
inflation projection also were seen as balanced.  The up-side risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that is still projected to be operating no-tably above potential for an extended period was coun-terbalanced by the downside risk that longer-term infla-
tion expectations may be lower than was assumed in the staff forecast, as well as th e possibility that the dollar 
could appreciate if foreign economic conditions deterio-
rated. 
Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the 
Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, members of the Board of Governors and Federal Reserv e Bank pres-
idents submitted their projections of the most likely out-comes for real GDP growth , the unemployment rate, 
and inflation for each year from 2019 through 2021 and 
over the longer run, based on their individual assess-
ments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate.  
The longer-run projections represented each partici-pant’s assessment of the ra te to which each variable 
would be expected to converge, over time, under appro-priate monetary policy and in the absence of further 
shocks to the economy.  Th ese projections and policy 
assessments are described in the Summary of Economic 
P r o j e c t i o n s  ( S E P ) ,  w h i c h  i s  a n  a d d e n d u m  t o  t h e s e  
minutes. 
Participants agreed that in formation received since the 
January meeting indicated that  the labor market had re-
mained strong but that growth of economic activity had slowed from its solid rate in the fourth quarter.  Payroll employment was little chan ged in February, but job 
gains had been solid, on average, in recent months, and 
the unemployment rate had re mained low.  Recent indi-
cators pointed to slower growth of household spending and business fixed investment in the first quarter.  On a 12-month basis, overall inflation had declined, largely as a result of lower energy prices; inflation for items other than food and energy remained near 2 percent.  On bal-ance, market-based measures of inflation compensation had remained low in recent months, and survey-based 
measures of longer-term inflation expectations were lit-
tle changed. 
Participants continued to vi ew a sustained expansion of 
economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committe e’s symmetric 2 percent ob-
jective as the most likely outcomes over the next few years.  Underlying economic fundamentals continued to support sustained expansion, and most participants in-
dicated that they did not expect the recent weakness in 
spending to persist beyond the first quarter.  Neverthe-less, participants generally ex pected the growth rate of 
real GDP this year to step down from the pace seen over 2018 to a rate at or modestly above their estimates of 
longer-run growth.  Participants cited various factors as Minutes of the Meeting of March 19–20, 2019 Page 9 ____________________________________________________________________________________________ _likely to contribute to the step-down, including slower 
foreign growth and waning effects of fiscal stimulus.  A 
number of participants judged that economic growth in 
the remaining quarters of 2019 and in the subsequent 
couple of years would likely be a little lower, on balance, 
than they had previously forecast.  Reasons cited for these downward revisions included disappointing news 
on global growth and less of a boost from fiscal policy than had previously been anticipated. 
In their discussion of the household sector, participants 
noted that softness in consumer spending had contrib-uted importantly to the projected slowing in economic 
growth in the current quarter.  Many participants 
pointed to the weakness in retail sales in December as notable, although they recognized that the data for Jan-uary had shown a partial recove ry in retail sales.  Partici-
pants also observed that much of the recent softness likely reflected temporary factors, such as the partial fed-eral government shutdown and December’s volatility in financial markets, and that consumer sentiment had re-
covered after these factors ha d receded.  Consequently, 
many participants expected consumer spending to pro-
ceed at a stronger pace in coming months, supported by favorable underlying factors,  including a strong labor 
market, solid growth in household incomes, improve-
ments in financial conditions  and in households’ balance 
sheet positions, and upbeat consumer sentiment.  Par-
ticipants noted, however, that the continued softness in 
the housing sector was a concern. 
Participants also commented on the apparent slowing of 
growth in business fixed inve stment in the first quarter.  
Factors cited as consistent with the recent softness in in-vestment growth included downward revisions in fore-casts of corporate earnings; relatively low energy prices that provided less incentive for new drilling and explo-
ration; flattening capital goods orders; reports from con-
tacts of softer export sales and of weaker economic ac-
tivity abroad; elevated leve ls of uncertainty about gov-
ernment policies, including trade policies; and the likely effect of recent financial market volatility on business 
sentiment.  However, many pa rticipants pointed to signs 
that the weakness in investment would likely abate.  Some contacts in manufact uring and other sectors re-
ported that business conditi ons were favorable, with 
strong demand for labor, bu siness sentiment had recov-
ered from its recent decline, and recent reductions in mortgage interest rates woul d provide some support for 
construction activity.  Agri cultural activity remained 
weak in various areas of the country, with the weakness in part reflecting adverse effects of trade policy on com-
modity prices.  Recent widespread severe flooding had also adversely affected the agricultural sector. 
Participants noted that the latest readings on overall in-
flation had been somewhat softer than expected.  How-
ever, participants observed that these readings largely re-flected the effects of earlier declines in crude oil prices and that core inflation remained near 2 percent.  Most participants, while seeing inflation pressures as muted, expected the overall rate of inflation to firm somewhat and to be at or near the Committee’s longer-run objec-tive of 2 percent over the next few years.  Many partici-
pants indicated that, while in flation had been close to 
2 percent last year, it was noteworthy that it had not shown greater signs of firming in response to strong la-
bor market conditions and ri sing nominal wage growth, 
as well as to the short-term  upward pressure on prices 
arising from tariff increases.  Low rates of price increases 
in sectors of the economy that  were not cyclically sensi-
tive were cited by a couple of  participants as one reason 
for the recent easing in infl ation.  A few participants ob-
served that the pickup in productivity growth last year was a welcome development he lping to bolster potential 
output and damp inflationary pressures. 
In their discussion of indicators of inflation expecta-
tions, participants noted that  market-based measures of 
inflation compensation had ri sen modestly over the in-
termeeting period, although they remained low.  A cou-
ple of participants stressed that recent readings on sur-
vey measures of infl ation expectations were also still at 
low levels.  Several particip ants suggested that longer-
term inflation expectations co uld be at levels somewhat 
below those consistent with the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective and that this might make it more dif-ficult to achieve that objec tive on a sustained basis. 
In their discussion of the labor market, participants cited 
evidence that conditions remained strong, including the 
very low unemployment rate, a further increase in the labor force participation rate, a low number of layoffs, near-record levels of j ob openings and help-wanted 
postings, and solid job gains, on average, in recent months.  Participants observed that, following strong job gains in January, there had been little growth in pay-rolls in February, although a few participants pointed out 
that the February reading had likely been affected by ad-
verse weather conditions.  A couple of participants 
noted that, over the medium term, some easing in pay-roll growth was to be expected as economic growth slowed to its longer-run tren d rate.  Reports from busi-
ness contacts predominantly pointed to continued Page 10 Federal Open Market Committee____________________________________________________________________________________________ _strong labor demand, with fi rms offering both higher 
wages and more nonwage benefi ts to attract workers.  
Economy-wide wage growth wa s seen as being broadly 
consistent with rece nt rates of labor pr oductivity growth 
and with inflation of 2 percent.  A few participants cited 
the combination of muted inflation pressures and ex-panding employment as a possible indication that some slack remained in the labor market. 
Participants commented on a number of risks associated 
with their outlook for economic activity.  A few partici-pants noted that there remained a high level of uncer-tainty associated with international developments, in-
cluding ongoing trade talks and Brexit deliberations, al-
though a couple of participants remarked that the risks 
of adverse outcomes were somewhat lower than in Jan-
uary.  Other downside risks included the possibility of sizable spillovers from a greater-than-expected eco-nomic slowdown in Europe and China, persistence of the softness in spending, or a sharp falloff in fiscal stim-
ulus.  A few participants observed that an economic de-
terioration in the United Stat es, if it occurred, might be 
amplified by significant debt service burdens for many firms.  Participants also mentioned a number of upside risks regarding the outlook fo r economic activity, includ-
ing outcomes in which various sources of uncertainty were resolved favorably, consumer and business senti-
ment rebounded sharply, or the recent strengthening in 
labor productivity growth signaled a pickup in the un-
derlying trend.  Upside risk s to the outlook for inflation 
included the possibility that wage pressures could rise unexpectedly and lead to greater-than-expected price in-creases. 
In their discussion of fina ncial developments, partici-
pants observed that a good deal of the tightening over the latter part of last year in financial conditions had since been reversed; Federal Reserve communications 
since the beginning of this year were seen as an im-
portant contributor to the recent improvements in fi-nancial conditions.  Particip ants noted that asset valua-
tions had recovered strongly and also discussed the de-
cline that had occurred in recent months in yields on longer-term Treasury securities.  Several participants ex-pressed concern that the yield curve for Treasury securi-ties was now quite flat and noted that historical evidence 
suggested that an inverted yield curve could portend 
economic weakness; however , their discussion also 
noted that the unusually low level of term premiums in longer-term interest rates made historical relationships a less reliable basis for assessing the implications of the 
recent behavior of the yield curve.  Several participants pointed to the increased debt issuance and higher lever-
age of nonfinancial corporati ons as a development that 
warranted continued monitoring. 
In their discussion of moneta ry policy decisions at the 
current meeting, participants agreed that it would be ap-
propriate to maintain the current target range for the f e d e r a l  f u n d s  r a t e  a t  2 ¼  t o  2 ½  p e r c e n t .   P a r t i c i p a n t s  judged that the labor market remained strong, but that information received over th e intermeeting period, in-
cluding recent readings on household spending and business fixed investment, po inted to slower economic 
growth in the early part of this year than in the fourth 
quarter of 2018.  Despite these indications of softer first-
quarter growth, participants generally expected eco-nomic activity to continue to expand, labor markets to 
remain strong, and inflation to  remain near 2 percent.  
Participants also noted significant uncertainties sur-rounding their economic outlooks, including those re-lated to global economic and fi nancial developments.  In 
light of these uncertainties as  well as continued evidence 
of muted inflation pressure s, participants generally 
agreed that a patient approach to determining future ad-justments to the target range for the federal funds rate remained appropriate.  Se veral participants observed 
that the characterization of the Committee’s approach to monetary policy as “patient” would need to be reviewed regularly as the economic outlook and uncertainties sur-rounding the outlook evolve.  A couple of participants 
noted that the “patient” char acterization should not be 
seen as limiting the Committee’s options for making pol-icy adjustments when they are deemed appropriate.   
With regard to the outlook for monetary policy beyond 
this meeting, a majority of participants expected that the 
evolution of the economic outlook and risks to the out-
look would likely warrant leaving the target range un-changed for the remainder of the year.  Several of these 
participants noted that the current target range for the 
federal funds rate was close to their estimates of its longer-run neutral level an d foresaw economic growth 
continuing near its longer-run  trend rate over the fore-
cast period.  Participants continued to emphasize that 
their decisions about the appropriate target range for the federal funds rate at coming  meetings would depend on 
their ongoing assessments of the economic outlook, as 
informed by a wide range of data, as well as on how the 
risks to the outlook evolved.  Several participants noted 
that their views of the appr opriate target range for the 
federal funds rate could shift in either direction based on 
incoming data and other de velopments.  Some partici-
pants indicated that if the economy evolved as they cur-rently expected, with economic growth above its longer-Minutes of the Meeting of March 19–20, 2019 Page 11 ____________________________________________________________________________________________ _run trend rate, they would likely judge it appropriate to 
raise the target range for the federal funds rate modestly 
later this year.   
Several participants expresse d concerns that the public 
had, at times, misinterpreted  the medians of participants’ 
assessments of the appropri ate level for the federal 
funds rate presented in the SEP as representing the con-sensus view of the Committee or  as suggesting that pol-
icy was on a preset course.  Such misinterpretations could complicate the Committee’s communications re-garding its view of appropri ate monetary policy, particu-
larly in circumstances when the future course of policy 
is unusually uncertain.  None theless, several participants 
noted that the policy rate projections in the SEP are a valuable component of the ov erall information provided 
about the monetary policy outlook.  The Chair noted that he had asked the subcommittee on communications to consider ways to improv e the information contained 
in the SEP and to improve communications regarding 
the role of the federal funds rate projections in the SEP 
as part of the policy process.    
Participants also discussed alternative interpretations of 
subdued inflation pressures in current economic circum-stances and the associated po licy implications.  Several 
participants observed that li mited inflationary pressures 
during a period of historically low unemployment could be a sign that low inflati on expectations were exerting 
downward pressure on inflation relative to the Commit-
tee’s 2 percent inflation targ et; in addition, subdued in-
flation pressures could indicate  a less tight labor market 
than suggested by common measures of resource utili-zation.  Consistent with th ese observations, several par-
ticipants noted that various indicators of inflation expec-tations had remained at the lo wer end of their historical 
range, and a few participants commented that they had recently revised down their estimates of the longer-run 
unemployment rate consistent with 2 percent inflation.  
In light of these consideratio ns, some participants noted 
that the appropriate response of the federal funds rate to 
signs of labor market tighte ning could be modest pro-
vided that signs of inflatio n pressures continued to be 
limited.  Some participants regarded their judgments that the federal funds rate was likely to remain on a very flat 
trajectory as reflecting other factors, such as low esti-
mates of the longer-run neutral real interest rate or risk-
management considerations.  A few participants ob-served that the appropriate path for policy, insofar as it implied lower interest rates for longer periods of time, 
could lead to greater financia l stability risks.  However, a 
couple of these participants noted that such financial sta-
bility risks could be addre ssed through appropriate use of countercyclical macropruden tial policy tools or other 
supervisory or regu latory tools.   
Committee Policy Action  
In their discussion of mone tary policy for the period 
ahead, members judged that the information received 
since the Committee met in January indicated that the labor market remained strong  but that growth of eco-
nomic activity had slowed fr om its solid rate in the 
fourth quarter.  Payroll em ployment was little changed 
in February, but job gains had been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had re-mained low.  Recent indicators pointed to slower growth 
of household spending and bu siness fixed investment in 
the first quarter.  On a 12-month basis, overall inflation had declined, largely as a result of lower energy prices; inflation for items other than food and energy remained near 2 percent.  On balance, market-based measures of inflation compensation had remained low in recent months, and survey-based measures of longer-term in-
flations expectations were little changed. 
In their consideration of the economic outlook, mem-
bers noted that financial co nditions had improved since 
the beginning of year, but that some time would be needed to assess whether indications of weak economic growth in the first quarter would persist in subsequent quarters.  Members also noted that inflationary pressures 
remained muted and that a number of uncertainties bearing on the U.S. and global economic outlook still 
awaited resolution.  However, members continued to 
view sustained expansion of  economic activity, strong 
labor market conditions, and inflation near the Commit-tee’s symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes for the U.S. economy in the period ahead.  In light of global economic and financial developments and 
muted inflation pressures, members concurred that the 
Committee could be patient as it determined what future 
adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate 
may be appropriate to support those outcomes. 
After assessing current conditions and the outlook for 
economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, mem-
bers decided to maintain the target range for the federal 
funds rate at 2¼ to 2½ percent.  Members agreed that 
in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Com-
mittee would assess realized and expected economic 
conditions relative to the Committee’s maximum- 
employment and symmetric 2 percent inflation objec-tives.  They reiterated that this assessment would take into account a wide range of information, including Page 12 Federal Open Market Committee____________________________________________________________________________________________ _measures of labor market conditions, indicators of infla-
tion pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and internationa l developments.  More gen-
erally, members noted that decisions regarding near-
term adjustments of the st ance of monetary policy 
would appropriately remain dependent on the evolution of the outlook as informed by incoming data. 
With regard to the postmeeting statement, members 
agreed to characterize the labor market as remaining strong.  While payroll employment had been little changed in February, job gain s had been solid, on aver-
age, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had 
remained low.  Members also agreed to note that growth 
in economic activity appeared  to have slowed from its 
solid rate in the fourth quarter, consistent with recent indicators of household spendi ng and business fixed in-
vestment.  The description of  overall inflation was re-
vised to recognize that inflation had declined, largely as a result of lower energy prices, while still noting that in-flation for items other than food and energy remained 
near 2 percent. 
At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee 
voted to authorize and direct  the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the fol-lowing domestic policy directive, to be released at 2:00 p.m.: 
“Effective March 21, 2019,  the Federal Open 
Market Committee directs the Desk to under-
take open market operat ions as necessary to 
maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 2¼ to 2½ percent, including overnight re-verse repurchase operations (and reverse repur-chase operations with maturities of more than one day when necessary to accommodate week-end, holiday, or similar trading conventions) at 
an offering rate of 2.25 percent, in amounts lim-
ited only by the value of Treasury securities held outright in the System Open Market Account that are available for such operations and by a per-counterparty limit of $30 billion per day. 
The Committee directs the Desk to continue 
rolling over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Fede ral Reserve’s holdings 
of Treasury securities maturing during each cal-
endar month that exceeds $30 billion, and to continue reinvesting in agency mortgage-backed securities the amount of principal pay-ments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed secu-
rities received during each calendar month that exceeds $20 billion.  Small deviations from these amounts for operational reasons are ac-
ceptable. 
The Committee also directs the Desk to engage 
in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve’s agency mortgage-backed securities transactions.” 
The vote also encompassed approval of the statement 
below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: 
“Information received since the Federal Open 
Market Committee met in January indicates that the labor market remains strong but that growth 
of economic activity has slowed from its solid rate in the fourth quarter.  Payroll employment was little changed in February, but job gains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate  has remained low.  
Recent indicators point to slower growth of 
household spending and business fixed invest-ment in the first quarter.  On a 12-month basis, 
overall inflation has declined, largely as a result of lower energy prices; inflation for items other 
than food and energy remains near 2 percent.  On balance, market-based measures of inflation compensation have remained low in recent 
months, and survey-based measures of longer-
term inflation expectations are little changed. 
Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Com-
mittee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  In support of these goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 2¼ to 2½ percent.  The Committee continues to view 
sustained expansion of economic activity, 
strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent ob-jective as the most likely outcomes.  In light of global economic and fina ncial developments 
and muted inflation pressures, the Committee will be patient as it determines what future ad-justments to the target range for the federal 
funds rate may be appropriate to support these 
outcomes. 
In determining the timing and size of future ad-
justments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized Minutes of the Meeting of March 19–20, 2019 Page 13 ____________________________________________________________________________________________ _and expected economic conditions relative to its 
maximum employment objective and its sym-metric 2 percent inflation objective.  This as-sessment will take into account a wide range of 
information, including measures of labor mar-
ket conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on fi-nancial and internatio nal developments.” 
Voting for this action:   Jerome H. Powell, John C. 
Williams, Michelle W. Bowman, Lael Brainard, James Bullard, Richard H. Clarida, Charles L. Evans, Esther L. George, Randal K. Quarles, and Eric Rosengren. 
Voting against this action:   None. 
Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the 
target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to leave the in-terest rates on required and excess reserve balances un-changed at 2.40 percent and voted unanimously to ap-
prove establishment of the primary credit rate at the ex-isting level of 3.00 percen t, effective March 21, 2019.  
It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee 
would be held on Tuesday –Wednesday, April 30 –

In conjunction with the Federal Open Market Commit-tee (FOMC) meeting held on March 19–20, 2019, meet-ing participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real gross domestic product (GDP) growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2019 to 2021 and ov er the longer run.  Each 
participant’s projections were based on information available at the time of the meeting, together with his or 
her assessment of appropria te monetary policy—includ-
ing a path for the federal funds rate and its longer-run 
value—and assumptions about ot her factors likely to af-
fect economic outcomes.  The longer-run projections represent each participant’s assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the ab-
sence of further shocks to the economy.
1  “Appropriate 
monetary policy” is defined as  the future path of policy 
that each participant deems most likely to foster out-comes for economic activity and inflation that best sat-isfy his or her individual in terpretation of the statutory 
mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability. 
Participants who submitted longer-run projections gen-
erally expected that, under appropriate monetary policy, 
growth of real GDP in 2019 would run at or somewhat 
above their individual estimates of its longer-run rate.  Most participants continued to expect real GDP growth 
to edge down over the projection horizon, with almost all participants projecting gr owth in 2021 to be at or be-
low their estimates of its longer-run rate.  All participants who submitted longer-run pr ojections continued to ex-
pect that the unemployment rate would run at or below 
their estimates of its longer-run level through 2021.  Al-
most all participants projecte d that inflation, as meas-
ured by the four-quarter percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), would increase slightly over the next two years, and most participants expected that it would be at or slightly above 
the Committee’s 2 percent objective in 2020 and 2021.  Compared with the Summary of Economic Projections 
(SEP) from December 2018, all participants marked 
down somewhat their projections for real GDP growth in 2019, and most revised down slightly their projections for total inflation in 2019.  Table 1 and figure 1 provide summary statistics for the projections. 
1 One participant did not submit longer-run projections for 
real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds 
rate. As shown in figure 2, most participants expected that 
the evolution of the economy, relative to their objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation, would likely warrant keeping the federal funds rate at its current level through the end of 2019.  The medians of partici-pants’ assessments of the appr opriate level of the federal 
funds rate in 2020 and 2021 were close to the median assessment of its longer-run level.  Compared with the 
December submissions, the me dian projections for the 
federal funds rate for the end of 2019, 2020, and 2021 were 50 basis points lower. 
A substantial majority of part icipants continued to view 
the uncertainty around their projections as broadly sim-
ilar to the average of the past 20 years.  While a majority of participants viewed the risks to the outlook as bal-anced, a couple more participants than in December 
viewed the risks to inflation as weighted to the downside. 
The Outlook for Economic Activity 
As shown in table 1, the medi an of participants’ projec-
tions for the growth rate of real GDP in 2019, condi-
tional on their individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy, was 2.1 percent.  Most participants continued to expect GDP growth to slow throughout the projection horizon, with the median projection at 
1.9 percent in 2020 and at 1.8 percent in 2021, a touch 
lower than the median estimate  of its longer-run rate of 
1.9 percent.  Relative to the December SEP, the medians of the projections for real GDP growth in 2019 and 2020 were 0.2 percentage point and 0.1 percentage point 
lower, respectively.  Most participants mentioned a re-
cent patch of weake r data on domestic economic activ-
ity, and some pointed to a softer global growth outlook, 
as factors behind the downwa rd revisions to their near-
term growth estimates. 
The median of projections fo r the unemployment rate in 
the fourth quarter of 2019 was 3.7 percent, about ½ per-centage point below the median  assessment of its longer-
run level.  The median projections for 2020 and 2021 were 3.8 percent and 3.9 perc ent, respectively.  These 
median unemployment rates were a little higher than 
those from the December SEP.   Nevertheless, most par-
ticipants continued to project that the unemployment rate in 2021 would be below their estimates of its longer-run level.

Note: Projections of change in real gross domestic product (GDP) and projections for both measures of inﬂation are percent changes from the
fourth quarter of the previous year to the fourth quarter of the year indicated. PCE inﬂation and core PCE inﬂation are the percentage rates of changein, respectively, the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and the price index for PCE excluding food and energy. Projections for
the unemployment rate are for the average civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated. Each participant’s projections are
based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy. Longer-run projections represent each participant’s assessment of the rate to which e ach
variable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. The projections for the
federal funds rate are the value of the midpoint of the projected appropriate target range for the federal funds rate or the projected appropriate targ et
level for the federal funds rate at the end of the speciﬁed calendar year or over the longer run. The December projections were made in conjunction with
the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on December 18–19, 2018. One participant did not submit longer-run projections for the change in
real GDP, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds rate in conjunction with the December 18–19, 2018, meeting, and one participant did not submit
such projections in conjunction with the March 19–20, 2019, meeting.
1. For each period, the median is the middle projection when the projections are arranged from lowest to highest. When the number of projections
is even, the median is the average of the two middle projections.
2. The central tendency excludes the three highest and three lowest projections for each variable in each year.3. The range for a variable in a given year includes all participants’ projections, from lowest to highest, for that variable in that year.

than in December. 
Figures 3.A and 3.B show the distributions of partici-
pants’ projections for real GDP growth and the unem-
ployment rate from 2019 to 2021 and in the longer run.  
The distribution of individual projections for real GDP growth for 2019 shifted down re lative to that in the De-
cember SEP, while the distributions for 2020, 2021, and the longer-run rate of GDP growth changed only slightly.  The distributions of  individual projections for 
the unemployment rate in 2019 and 2020 moved mod-estly higher relative to those in December, and the dis-
tribution in 2021 edged higher  as well.  Meanwhile, the 
distribution for the longer -run unemployment rate 
shifted down a touch. 
The Outlook for Inflation 
As shown in table 1, the medi ans of projections for total 
PCE price inflation were 1.8 percent in 2019 and 2.0 percent in both 2020 and 2021, each a touch lower than in the December SEP.  The medians of projections 
for core PCE price inflation over the 2019–21 period 
were 2.0 percent, the same as in December. 
Figures 3.C and 3.D provide information on the distri-
butions of participants’ views about the outlook for in-flation.  The distributions of projections for total PCE 
price inflation and core PCE price inflation in 2019, 2020, and 2021 shifted down slightly from the Decem-ber SEP.  Almost all participants expected that total and 
core PCE price inflation would be between 1.8 and 
2.2 percent throughout the projection horizon. 
Appropriate Monetary Policy 
Figure 3.E shows distributi ons of participants’ judg-
ments regarding the appropri ate target—or midpoint of 
the target range—for the federal funds rate at the end of each year from 2019 to 2021 an d over the longer run.  
The distributions for 2019 through 2021 shifted toward 
lower values.  Compared with the projections prepared 
for the December SEP, the median federal funds rate was 50 basis points lower each year over the 2019–21 period.  At the end of 2019, the median of federal funds rate projections was 2.38 percent, consistent with no rate 
increases over the course of  2019.  Thereafter, the medi-
ans of the projections were 2.63 percent at the end of 
both 2020 and 2021, slightly lower than the median of 
the longer-run projections of  the federal funds rate of 
2.75 percent.  Muted inflat ionary pressures and risk- 
management considerations we re both cited as factors 
contributing to the downward revisions in participants’ assessments of the appropriat e path for the policy rate.  
The distribution of individual projections for the longer-run federal funds rate ticked  down from December.   Table 2.  Average historical projection error ranges

As described in the box “Forecast Uncertainty,” under certain assumptions, there is about a 70 percent probability that actual outcomes for real GDP, unemployment, consumer prices, and the federal funds rate will be in ranges implied by the average si ze of projection errors made in the 
past.  For more information , see David Reifschneider and Peter Tulip

torical Forecasting Errors:  The Federal Reserve’s Approach,” Finance

1.  Definitions of variables are in the general note to table 1. 2.  Measure is the overall consumer price index, the price measure 
that has been most widely used in government and private economic forecasts.  Projections are percent changes on a fourth quarter to fourth quarter basis. 
3.  For Federal Reserve staff forecasts, measure is the federal funds 
rate.  For other forecasts, measure is the rate on 3-month Treasury bills.  Projection errors are calculated using average levels, in percent, in the fourth quarter. 
 
Uncertainty and Risks In assessing the appropriate path of the federal funds 
rate, FOMC participants take account of the range of possible economic outcomes, the likelihood of those outcomes, and the potential benefits and costs should they occur.  As a reference, table 2 provides measures of forecast uncertainty—based on the forecast errors of 
various private and government  forecasts over the past 
20 years—for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and total PCE price infl ation.  Those measures are 
represented graphically in the “fan charts” shown in the top panels of figures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C.  The fan charts display the SEP medians for the three variables sur-
rounded by symmetric confidence intervals derived from the forecast errors reported in table 2.  If the de-
gree of uncertainty attending these projections is similar 
to the typical magnitude of past forecast errors and the risks around the projections are broadly balanced, then future outcomes of these va riables would have about a 
70 percent probability of being within these confidence intervals.  For all three vari ables, this measure of uncer-
tainty is substantial and gene rally increases as the fore-
cast horizon lengthens. 
Participants’ assessments of the level of uncertainty sur-
rounding their individual economic projections are shown in the bottom-left pane ls of figures 4.A, 4.B, and 
4.C.

and inflation as broadly similar to the average of the past 
20 years.2 
Because the fan charts are constructed to be symmetric 
around the median projections, they do not reflect any asymmetries in the balance of risks that participants may see in their economic projections.  Participants’ assess-ments of the balance of risk s to their current economic 
projections are shown in the bottom-right panels of fig-ures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C.  A majority of participants judged the risks to the outlook for real GDP growth, the unem-
ployment rate, total inflati on, and core inflation as 
broadly balanced—in other word s, as broadly consistent 
with a symmetric fan chart.  The balance of risks to the projection for real GDP growth  shifted a bit lower, with 
four participants assessing the risks as weighted to the downside and no participant seeing it weighted to the upside.  The balance of risks to the projection for the unemployment rate moved a touch higher, with three 
participants judging the risk s to the unemployment rate 
as weighted to the upside and two participants viewing the risks as weighted to the downside.  In addition, the balance of risks to the inflat ion projections shifted down 
slightly relative to Decemb er.  Two more participants 
than in December saw the risks to the inflation projec-
tions as weighted to the downside, and no participant judged the risks as weighted to the upside. 
In discussing the uncertainty and risks surrounding their 
economic projections, trade te nsions as well as develop-

of uncertainty or downside risk to the economic growth 
outlook.  For the inflation outlook, the effect of trade 
restrictions was cited as an upside risk, while the concern 
that inflation expectations could be drifting below the 
FOMC’s objective and the potential for a stronger dollar and weaker domestic demand to put downward pressure 
on inflation were viewed as downside risks.  A number of participants mentioned that  their assessments of risks 
remained roughly balanced in part as a result of their downward revisions to the a ppropriate federal funds rate 
path. 
Participants’ assessments of the appropriate future path 
of the federal funds rate are also subject to considerable uncertainty.  Because the Committee adjusts the federal funds rate in response to actual and prospective devel-
opments over time in key economic variables such as real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation, uncertainty surrounding the projected path for the fed-eral funds rate importantly reflects the uncertainties 
about the paths for these economic variables along with 
other factors.  Figure 5 provides a graphical representa-tion of this uncertainty, plo tting the SEP median for the 
federal funds rate surrounded  by confidence intervals 
derived from the results pres ented in table 2.  As with 
the macroeconomic variables, the forecast uncertainty surrounding the appropriate path of the federal funds rate is substantial and incr eases for longer horizons.

The actual values are the midpoint of thetarget range; the median projected values are based on either the midpoint of the target range or the target level.The conﬁdence interval around the median projected values is based on root mean squared errors of various privateand government forecasts made over the previous 20 years. The conﬁdence interval is not strictly consistent with theprojections for the federal funds rate, primarily because these projections are not forecasts of the likeliest outcomes forthe federal funds rate, but rather projections of participants’ individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy.
Still, historical forecast errors provide a broad sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate
generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policythat may be appropriate to oﬀset the eﬀects of shocks to the economy.
The conﬁdence interval is assumed to be symmetric except when it is truncated at zero—the bottom of the lowest
target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted in the past by the Committee. This truncation wouldnot be intended to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policyaccommodation if doing so was judged appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools,including forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation. Because current
conditions may diﬀer from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the
conﬁdence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reﬂect FOMC participants’ currentassessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections.

The economic projections provided by the members of 
the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal 
Reserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy among 
policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis for policy actions.  Considerable uncertainty attends these projections, however.  The economic and statistical models 
and relationships used to help produce economic forecasts 
are necessarily imperfect descriptions of the real world, and the future path of the economy can be affected by myriad 
unforeseen developments and events.  Thus, in setting the 
stance of monetary policy, participants consider not only 
what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as em-bodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the poten-
tial costs to the economy should they occur. 
Table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a 
range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary 
Policy Report s and those prepared by the Federal Reserve 
Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open 
Market Committee (FOMC).  The projection error ranges 
shown in the table illustrate th e considerable uncertainty as-
sociated with economic forecasts.  For example, suppose a 
participant projects that real gross domestic product (GDP) 
and total consumer prices will rise steadily at annual rates of, respectively, 3 percent and 2 percent.  If the uncertainty at-tending those projections is similar to that experienced in the 
past and the risks around the projections are broadly bal-
anced, the numbers reported in table 2 would imply a prob-
ability of about 70 percent th at actual GDP would expand 
within a range of 1.6 to 4.4 percent in the current year and 
1.1 to 4.9 percent in the second and third years.  The corre-
sponding 70 percent confidence intervals for overall infla-tion would be 1.1 to 2.9 percent in the current year, 1.0 to 3.0 percent in the second year, and 0.9 to 3.1 percent in the 
third year.  Figures 4.A thro ugh 4.C illustrate these confi-
dence bounds in “fan charts” that are symmetric and cen-tered on the medians of FOMC participants’ projections for 
GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation.  How-
ever, in some instances, the risks around the projections may 
not be symmetric.  In particular, the unemployment rate can-
not be negative; furthermore, the risks around a particular projection might be tilted to either the upside or the down-
side, in which case the corresponding fan chart would be 
asymmetrically positioned arou nd the median projection. 
Because current conditions may differ from those that 
prevailed, on average, over history, participants provide 
judgments as to whether the uncertainty attached to their 
projections of each economic variable is greater than, smaller 
than, or broadly similar to typical levels of forecast uncer-tainty seen in the past 20 years, as presented in table 2 and 
reflected in the widths of the confidence intervals shown in 
the top panels of figures 4.A through 4.C.  Participants’ cur-rent assessments of the uncertainty surrounding their projec-
 tions are summarized in the bottom-left panels of those fig-
ures.  Participants also provide judgments as to whether the 
risks to their projections are weighted to the upside, are 
weighted to the downside, or are broadly balanced.  That is, while the symmetric historical fan charts shown in the top panels of figures 4.A through 4.C imply that the risks to par-
ticipants’ projections are balanced, participants may judge that 
there is a greater risk that a gi ven variable will be above rather 
than below their projections.  These judgments are summa-rized in the lower-right panels of figures 4.A through 4.C. 
As with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the 
future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable 
uncertainty.  This uncertainty arises primarily because each 
participant’s assessment of the appropriate stance of mone-
tary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real ac-
tivity and inflation over time.  If economic conditions evolve in an unexpected manner, then assessments of the appropri-
ate setting of the federal funds rate would change from that 
point forward.  The final line in table 2 shows the error ranges 
for forecasts of short-term interest rates.  They suggest that the historical confidence intervals associated with projections of the federal funds rate are quite wide.  It should be noted, 
however, that these confidence intervals are not strictly con-
sistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, as these 
projections are not forecasts of the most likely quarterly out-comes but rather are projections of participants’ individual as-
sessments of appropriate monetary policy and are on an end-
of-year basis.  However, the forecast errors should provide a sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeco-
nomic variables as well as additi onal adjustments to monetary 
policy that would be appropriate to offset the effects of 
shocks to the economy. 
If at some point in the future the confidence interval 
around the federal funds rate were to extend below zero, it 
would be truncated at zero for purposes of the fan chart shown in figure 5; zero is the bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted by the 
Committee in the past.  This approach to the construction of 
the federal funds rate fan chart would be merely a convention; it would not have any implicati ons for possible future policy 
decisions regarding the use of negative interest rates to pro-
vide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so 
were appropriate.  In such situations, the Committee could 
also employ other tools, including forward guidance and asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation. 
While figures 4.A through 4.C provide information on 
the uncertainty around the economic projections, figure 1 
provides information on the range of views across FOMC 
participants.  A comparison of figure 1 with figures 4.A 
through 4.C shows that the dispersion of the projections 
across participants is much smaller than the average forecast errors over the past 20 years.
